Dataset_Abstract,"Provides all data used for the creation of the maps and spearman    correlation analysis for a lead risk assessment of North and West    Philadelphia. This includes data on: lead-in-soil, land recycled    sites, demolitions, housing code violations, age of housing,    smelters, and elevated blood lead levels of children. The data was    used for a spatial analysis of historic and current lead sources in    West and North Philadelphia to determine which lead sources act as    primary lead-risk factors, identify future soil sampling sites and    high-risk neighborhoods in Philadelphia."
Dataset_Methods,"The study area, broadly defined as West, North, and Upper North    Philadelphia includes ninety-four census tracts. Data for the    thirteen considered lead-risk factors were collected from various    sources. Blood lead levels, demolition, and housing code violation    data are collected by the City of Philadelphia and were retrieved    from OpenPhillyData. Lead-risk factors such as children in poverty,    age of property, median income, and minority population were    collected by the U.S Census Bureau and taken from the 2015-2019    American Community Survey. The soil data were collected by the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and through the University of    Pennsylvania’s Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) Course on    Lead and graduate students working through the Center of Excellence    in Environmental Toxicology in Philadelphia. Soil samples were also    taken by residents, as organized by the EPA, universities, and    farmer/gardener groups, who collected five samples from the top 0-15    cm of soil in their yards, and recorded the nearest intersection for    the sake of identity protection. Lead concentrations were then    determined using portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometers    (Innov-X Delta). In the case of the ABCS course, samples were    collected primarily by students between 2015 and 2020, where    students were instructed to collect 5 samples from the top ~1.5 cm    of soil. Again, portable XRF spectrometers were used to determine    the lead concentration. Smelter data were retrieved from both the    EPA’s Superfund Program Database and the paper Discovering    Unrecognized Lead-Smelting Sites by Historical Methods. Brownfield    and land recycled sites were taken from Pennsylvania’s Department of    Environmental Protection website.; This method step describes provenance-based metadata; This provenance metadata does not contain entity specific information.; Philadelphia Department of Public Health; mary.figgatt@phila.gov; information; https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-child-blood-lead-levels; Department of Licenses and Inspections; ligisteam@phila.gov; https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/building-demolitions; https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/licenses-and-inspections-violations; https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/HQ/201391; http://cedatareporting.pa.gov/Reportserver/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/Public/DEP/LRP/SSRS/LandRecycling_Sites_Complete; data.census.gov"
